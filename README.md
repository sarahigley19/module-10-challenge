# module-10-challenge
I was asked to make an SVG Logo Maker using node and object oritented programming.

##  Project Description
This project ended up being kind of fun in the end! I ran into a few issues with my text not appearing big enough or in the center of the shape. I  was able to fix the size and get it to appear in the shape, but still had some issues of it appearing in the middle. I also was able do get my test to work, albeit not the triangle. I still think this project turned out pretty good!
